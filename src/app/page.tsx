    The global digital economy has outpaced the financial infrastructure supporting it. Legacy
    systems remain expensive, exclusionary, and opaque, while existing crypto solutions struggle
    with volatility and fragmentation. NetDag was created to unify real-world financial utility
    with decentralized scalability, trust, and inclusion. Our philosophy is to build{" "}
    <strong>trust through transparency</strong>, enable growth through <strong>utility</strong>,
    and stabilize the crypto economy via innovative mechanisms that merge DAG concepts with
    bonding-curve dynamics.
