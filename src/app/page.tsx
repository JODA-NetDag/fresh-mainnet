    The global digital economy has outpaced the financial infrastructure supporting it. Legacy systems remain
    expensive, exclusionary, and opaque, while existing crypto solutions struggle with volatility and fragmentation.
    NetDag was created to unify real-world financial utility with decentralized scalability, trust, and inclusion.
    Our philosophy is to build trust <em>through transparency</em>, enable growth <em>through utility</em>, and stabilize
    the crypto economy via innovative mechanisms that merge DAG concepts with bonding-curve dynamics.
